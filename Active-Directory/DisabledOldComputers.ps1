# This PowerShell Command will query Active Directory and return the computer accounts which have not logged for the past
# 30 days.  You can easily change the number of days from 30 to any number of your choosing. After, the computers will be
# moved to the "DisabledComputers" OU

# Email notification will be sent to techops@ingomoney.com

# Note: This script needs to be run with administrator priviledges.
#       If script is not run with administrator priviledges,
#       Get-QADUser function will not return PasswordExpires and PwdLastSetattributes correctly.
#
#       You might need to sign the powershell script so that it can run inbatch mode (as opposed to interactive mode).
#       To do that, you will need to run elevated command prompt, runpowershell (by typing powershell on the command prompt),
#       next, type "set-executionpolicy RemoteSigned" (without the doublequotes) on the powershell prompt.
