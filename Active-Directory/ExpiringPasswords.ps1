# Start of script
# ExpiringPasswords.ps1
# 12/30/2009
#
#
# Purpose:
# Powershell script to find out a list of users
# whose password is expiring within x number of days (as specified in $days_before_expiry).
# Email notification will be sent to them reminding them that they need to change their password.
#
# Requirements:
# ExpiringPasswords.ps1 is dependant on Quest.ActiveRoles.ADManagementsnapin to get the AD attributes.
# The Quest.ActiveRoles.ADManagement snapin can be downloaded from'PowerShell Commands (CMDLETs) for Active Directory by Quest Software'(http://www.quest.com/powershell/activeroles-server.aspx)
# Look for ActiveRoles Management Shell for Active Directory (both32-bit or 64-bit versions available)
# Also available in P:\Software\Microsoft\Windows Powershell snap-in.
#
# Note: This script needs to be run with administrator priviledges.
#       If script is not run with administrator priviledges,
#       Get-QADUser function will not return PasswordExpires and PwdLastSetattributes correctly.
#
#       You might need to sign the powershell script so that it can run inbatch mode (as opposed to interactive mode).
#       To do that, you will need to run elevated command prompt, runpowershell (by typing powershell on the command prompt),
#       next, type "set-executionpolicy RemoteSigned" (without the doublequotes) on the powershell prompt.
